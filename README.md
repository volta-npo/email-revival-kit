## ✨ What it does

**Email Revival Kit** is a polished, local-first open-source tool from Volta's open-source program. It helps Marketing teams helping owners restart email without spamming turn real community work into structured evidence, client-safe handoffs, and mentor-reviewable release packets.

> **Volta principle:** digital equity is economic equity. Every tool in this collection is designed so students can ship useful, accountable technology for small businesses, nonprofits, and community organizations that are usually priced out of high-quality digital transformation.

### The gap it closes

Email platforms exist, but small businesses need strategy, consent hygiene, and simple restart sequences.

### The niche

Dormant local customer relationships.

### North-star metric

`inactive contacts re-engaged ethically`

## 🟦 TypeScript-first

This repository is authored in **TypeScript**. The checked-in JavaScript files are compiled artifacts so the project can run directly on GitHub Pages without a build server.

- Source: `src/**/*.ts` and `test/**/*.ts`
- Build: `npm run build`
- Runtime artifacts: `src/**/*.js` for static hosting

## 🏗️ Production infrastructure

This repo is designed to be usable as a real OSS product, not just a static demo.

| Layer | Included |
|---|---|
| Reproducible build | `package-lock.json`, `npm ci`, TypeScript build artifacts |
| Local runtime | Static app via `npm start` |
| Container runtime | `Dockerfile`, `docker-compose.yml`, hardened Nginx config |
| Developer environment | `.devcontainer/devcontainer.json` |
| Operations | `Makefile`, `.env.example`, deployment docs, API docs |
| CI/CD | GitHub Actions CI, release artifact workflow, Dependabot |

---

## 🛠️ Quick start

```bash
git clone https://github.com/volta-npo/email-revival-kit.git
cd 29-email-revival-kit
npm install
npm test
npm start
```

Then open the local URL shown by Python, usually:

```text
http://localhost:4173
```

No install step is required for the app itself. Tests use Node's built-in test runner.

---

## 🧪 Validation

This repository includes **25 automated tests** covering core scoring, domain behavior, v1 release behavior, and release certification.

```bash
npm test
```

Test coverage includes:

- configuration weights and launch readiness
- product-specific domain sample data
- artifact generation and markdown exports
- v1 launch packet behavior
- release import/export round trips
- wrong-product import rejection
- deterministic integrity hashes
- blocked/critical gate prevention
- markdown safety checks

## 🌍 Why Volta is open-sourcing this

Volta works with students, nonprofits, and small businesses to make practical digital transformation accessible. These repositories are intentionally:

- **small enough to understand** in a student pod
- **useful enough to run** in a real community engagement
- **safe enough to hand off** to a nontechnical owner
- **structured enough to review** by mentors and sponsors
- **open enough to fork** for any chapter or community group

---

## 🤝 Contributing

Contributions are welcome if they improve real-world usefulness for under-resourced organizations. The best issues include:

1. a real user or chapter scenario,
2. before/after evidence,
3. privacy and accessibility considerations,
4. a test or release-checklist update.
